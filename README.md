# ModelTest

This is a program for testing the efficiency of the training model generated using the OpenCV library. In the program we load an image of a handwritten number in the range 0-9.
Using the OpenCV library we process the image to the size and format for further analyzing. The program outputs a number for which it gets the
highest probability in the analysis.
